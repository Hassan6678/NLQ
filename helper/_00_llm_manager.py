### Given the following table schema and context:

# Table: {table_name_for_prompt}
# Schema: {schema}
# Total rows: {row_count:,}
{sample_context}
{stats_context}

### CRITICAL DUCKDB CONSTRAINTS:
- Use ONLY DuckDB-compatible SQL syntax
- NEVER use window functions like LAG(), LEAD(), ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
- NEVER use OVER() clauses with PARTITION BY or ORDER BY
- For growth/trend analysis, use CASE statements with month comparisons instead
- Use CTEs (WITH clauses) for complex calculations when needed

### IMPORTANT RULE TO AVOID HALLUCINATIONS FROM EXAMPLES/SAMPLES:
- Do NOT use values appearing in the sample data/context as implicit filters. Never invent filters (region/city/brand/etc.) based on sample rows unless the NLQ explicitly requests them.

### Important guidelines:
- Use DuckDB SQL syntax
 - The ONLY available table is named "{table_name_for_prompt}". You must use exactly this table name in all FROM and JOIN clauses. Do not invent any other table names.
- For large datasets, consider using LIMIT for exploratory queries
- Use appropriate aggregations for summary queries
- Handle NULL values appropriately
- Use proper date/time functions if applicable
 - Columns may include names with spaces (e.g., "primary sales"). When referencing such columns, use double quotes, e.g., "primary sales".
 - Months and years are integers. If the question mentions a quarter (Q1..Q4), map to months: Q1={{1,2,3}}, Q2={{4,5,6}}, Q3={{7,8,9}}, Q4={{10,11,12}}.
 - Boolean flags (e.g., productivity, stockout, assortment) are stored as 0/1 integers. Use predicates like column = 1 or column = 0. Avoid TRUE/FALSE.
 - Do NOT use window functions (e.g., LAG/LEAD) in the WHERE clause. If you need to filter on a window, use QUALIFY or compute in a subquery/CTE and filter in the outer query.
 - Never use placeholder years like 20XX/XXXX or partial years (e.g., 20). Use actual 4-digit years present in the table. If the year isn't specified, prefer the latest available year for the requested month(s).
 - Do NOT add region/city/area/territory/distributor/route filters unless explicitly mentioned in the user's question.
 - **CRITICAL**: For region queries, distinguish between:
   - **General region queries** (e.g., "top 5 regions", "all regions", "highest sales by region"): Do NOT add any region filters, just GROUP BY region
   - **Specific region queries** (e.g., "sales in Central-A", "performance in North region"): Add the exact region filter using `LOWER(region) = 'region-name'`
 - If the user asks a general question about totals or rankings (e.g., "highest sales", "top performance") without specifying a dimension, provide a high-level summary by `region`. Do not add other filters unless specified.
 - For city-specific questions, use a simple `WHERE LOWER(city) = '...'` filter. Do not use complex joins if the information is in the same table. Only add this if the user clearly mentions a specific city name in the question â€” the user may name a city without the word "city" (e.g., "lahore"). If the NLQ contains a city token present in the dataset, include the city filter; otherwise do not invent one.
 - For all string comparisons in `WHERE` clauses, use the `LOWER()` function for case-insensitive matching (e.g., `LOWER(city) = 'karachi'`).
 - When the NLQ explicitly mentions a location (region/city/area/territory/distributor/route), exclude rows where `route = 'UNK'` from sales summaries by adding `route <> 'UNK'` to the WHERE clause.
 - If no location is mentioned in the NLQ, do not automatically add `route <> 'UNK'` or any location filters; return totals over the full dataset (subject to time defaults).

### Dataset information
- The ONLY table to use is "{table_name_for_prompt}" (use this exact name).
- Data is monthly with integer columns: month (1..12), year (e.g., 2024).
- Columns include: region, city, area, territory, distributor, route, customer, sku, brand, variant, packtype, sales, "primary sales", target, mto, productivity, mro, stockout, assortment, and specialized mro components.
- If the user specifies explicit months and/or year in the question, USE THOSE EXACT PERIODS in the SQL. Do NOT change or infer different months/years.
- If the question omits months/years, prefer the latest available period(s).
- **Do NOT invent or add any dimension filters (region/city/area/territory/distributor/route/brand/sku/customer) that are not explicitly present in the user's question.** Only include such filters when the NLQ contains clear, explicit mentions.
- Region to city mapping: Central-A is lahore, South-C is hyderabad, Central-B is faisalabad, Central-D is gujranwala, Central-C is multan, North-B is peshawar, North-A is rawalpindi, South-B is sukkur, South-A is karachi.

### Supported query types
- Sales/revenue totals and rankings by any dimension.
- Growth analysis (latest vs previous month; or user-specified periods/quarters).
- Targets and gaps: use mto for "missed target"/"target gap" (do not compute target - sales or target - mro). Use SUM() when ranking totals of sales/mro/mto across groups (avoid MAX for these totals).
- Productivity/assortment/stockout counts and percentages (COUNT(DISTINCT customer)/total).
  When the NLQ asks for "highest stockouts" by some dimension in a period and optional region, compute:
  - stockout_count = SUM(CASE WHEN stockout = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
  - stockout_percentage = stockout_count * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0)
  And order by stockout_percentage DESC, then stockout_count DESC.
 - Stockout analysis: For "highest stockouts" by a dimension (e.g., brands) in a period and region,
   compute both count and percentage in one query, e.g.:
   SELECT brand,
          SUM(CASE WHEN stockout = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS stockout_count,
          COUNT(*) AS total_records,
          (SUM(CASE WHEN stockout = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0)) AS stockout_percentage
   FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
   WHERE LOWER(region) = 'north-a' AND month = 7 AND year = 2025
   GROUP BY brand
   ORDER BY stockout_percentage DESC, stockout_count DESC
   LIMIT 5;
- Time filters: specific months, years, or quarters (Q1..Q4).

### Example patterns (adjust filters and dimensions):
1) Highest sales route in Karachi for a specific year:
SELECT route, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE LOWER(city) = 'karachi' AND year = 2025 AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;

2) Worst productivity percentage by distributor in a city for a month:
SELECT region, city, area, territory, distributor,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 9 AND year = 2024 AND productivity = 1 THEN customer END) AS productive_shops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 9 AND year = 2024 AND productivity = 0 THEN customer END) AS unproductive_shops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer) AS total_shops,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 9 AND year = 2024 AND productivity = 1 THEN customer END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT customer)) AS productivity_percentage,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 9 AND year = 2024 AND productivity = 0 THEN customer END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT customer)) AS unproductivity_percentage
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE LOWER(city) = 'lahore' AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY region, city, area, territory, distributor
ORDER BY unproductivity_percentage DESC
LIMIT 1;

3) Routes with highest stockout percentage in a region for a month:
SELECT region, city, area, territory, distributor, route,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 12 AND year = 2024 AND stockout = 1 THEN customer END) AS stockout_shops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 12 AND year = 2024 AND stockout = 0 THEN customer END) AS not_stockout_shops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer) AS total_shops,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 12 AND year = 2024 AND stockout = 1 THEN customer END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT customer)) AS stockout_percentage
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE LOWER(region) = 'north b' AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY region, city, area, territory, distributor, route
ORDER BY stockout_percentage DESC
LIMIT 1;

4) City growth (use user-specified periods as-is; otherwise use latest vs previous):
SELECT region, city,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month = <latest_month> THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_current_month,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month = <previous_month> THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_previous_month,
  ((SUM(CASE WHEN month = <latest_month> THEN sales ELSE 0 END) -
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = <previous_month> THEN sales ELSE 0 END)) /
   NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN month = <previous_month> THEN sales ELSE 0 END), 0)) * 100 AS sales_growth_percentage
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE LOWER(city) = 'lahore' AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY region, city
ORDER BY sales_growth_percentage DESC
LIMIT 1;

5) Brands with highest stockout percentage in a region for a month:
SELECT brand,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 11 AND year = 2024 AND stockout = 1 THEN customer END) AS stockout_shops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer) AS total_shops,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 11 AND year = 2024 AND stockout = 1 THEN customer END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT customer), 0)) AS stockout_percentage
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE LOWER(region) = 'north-a' AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY stockout_percentage DESC
LIMIT 5;

6) Route with highest missed target (use mto) within filters:
SELECT route, SUM(mto) AS total_mto
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE LOWER(region) = 'south-a' AND month = 12 AND year = 2024 AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY total_mto DESC
LIMIT 1;

7) Lowest productive area in Central-A region for a month (specific region):
SELECT area,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 2 AND year = 2024 AND productivity = 1 THEN customer END) AS productive_shops,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer) AS total_shops,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN month = 2 AND year = 2024 AND productivity = 1 THEN customer END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT customer), 0)) AS productivity_percentage
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE LOWER(region) = 'central-a' AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY area
ORDER BY productivity_percentage ASC
LIMIT 1;

8) Region with most growth potential (comparing two months):
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT region, month, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
    FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
    WHERE year = 2024 AND route <> 'UNK'
    GROUP BY region, month
)
SELECT region,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN month = 12 THEN total_sales END) -
        SUM(CASE WHEN month = 11 THEN total_sales END)) * 100.0 /
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN month = 11 THEN total_sales END), 0) AS sales_growth_percentage
FROM monthly_sales
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY sales_growth_percentage DESC
LIMIT 1;

9) Top 5 regions by sales in a specific month (general region query - NO region filters):
SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE month = 1 AND year = 2025 AND route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

10) Territory growth analysis (avoiding window functions):
SELECT territory,
       SUM(CASE WHEN month = 12 AND year = 2024 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_december,
       SUM(CASE WHEN month = 11 AND year = 2024 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_november,
       ((SUM(CASE WHEN month = 12 AND year = 2024 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) -
         SUM(CASE WHEN month = 11 AND year = 2024 THEN sales ELSE 0 END)) /
        NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN month = 11 AND year = 2024 THEN sales ELSE 0 END), 0)) * 100 AS growth_percentage
FROM {table_name_for_prompt}
WHERE route <> 'UNK'
GROUP BY territory
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN month = 11 AND year = 2024 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) > 0
ORDER BY growth_percentage DESC
LIMIT 5;
